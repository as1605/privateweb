		<h4>A little note from my side</h4>
		5 April 2021<p>
		1,03,794. We had 1,03,794 new cases of covid yesterday. And we can do nothing about it. The curve is steep, and it might take at least 3-4 months for it to fall again. If the institute decides to extend the online semester, we cannot change their decision, and we should not. 
<p>
		All we can do is change how we cope with it and how we can make it easier for ourselves. 
<p>
		Posts and memes and rants and requests about how much we want to go to campus are almost as old as the lockdown itself, but they will only frustrate us more and increase our stress after one point. Yeah, we get it, we want to go to the campus, it is one of the best places for us to be at, and much more than that, the idea of getting back to campus feels close to one of the things getting back to normal, of undoing all the damage that we went through last year.
<p>
		But that should not mean that we have to think our lives online should be miserable or that we have to be sad or frustrated about it until we finally get to be on the campus.
<p>
		At least we can improve our quality of life online and stay connected, even if you have been an introvert otherwise. Try to keep things very friendly and try not to do anything which would bother people. Also, avoid sharing things that would just add to the negativity. We can at least create a positive atmosphere for ourselves and a strong support system. Also, a little venting is okay, but don't let it go to the point where it just brings down the morale, that there is no hope in the subject and the course itself is bad, or that the online semester is a complete waste of our college life. 
<p>
		Even if the professors don't help, we still can work and help each other out in studying. Ask around in the groups, attend the extra sessions by mentors, explore the topics on the internet, and keep sharing anything of help you find.
<p>
		At the end of the day, you need not stress yourself out too much over academics. Just do whatever you can do, staying in your comfortable range, and have some personal time to take of yourself. We have had a competitive nature, but you do not necessarily need to stretch yourself out for everything. It is more important to keep your spirit and interest alive rather than burning out. It is okay if you get a grade less, it is a price worth paying for keeping your health well. That lecture is not worth pulling an all-nighter for. 
<p>
		Don't stretch yourself out too much if you're unable to complete the syllabus. (Maybe just go through the tut solutions and attempt whatever you know in the exams.) Don't let bad results of any test cripple you from moving forward, and do not let it make you feel like a loser if it went bad (or a winner if it went great). 
		Just say lol and move on. There is not enough time to feel bad about it. You have to walk it off and focus on what is next.

		<h4>Fresher's Letter to the Director</h4>

1 May 2021
<p>We asked for support.
<p>
It was not a matter of challenging the students on how long they can continue and fight this situation, or whether they can study and give exams while being infected, or after how long we decide to give up and take the &#39;I&#39; grade.
<p>
I am writing to you as a student of the Corona Batch, if you remember we are the ones who faced the toughest challenges while giving the JEE Advanced, we gave the toughest exam even when the pandemic situation was at it&#39;s then-peak, we ignored medical warnings and predictions and scientific projections which said that September would have the peak and the curve would fall after it, just because at that time you decided that postponing further would not help and that it was utmost necessary to hold them exactly around the peak. We had kept our trust and hope strong in the IIT Delhi administration even before we were marked worthy of coming here.
<p>
It is safe to say that we are one of the most mentally robust batches of students you have ever got, the ones who would &#34;quit&#34; or go with &#34;excuses&#34; or the ones who would &#34;cripple under pressure&#34; had already been eliminated. We are not new to challenges.
<p>
But we are tired now.
<p>
First of all, we need to understand the nature of the coronavirus infections. It mostly starts with mild symptoms, and in some cases, the patient might not even get the symptoms in some cases. It may even appear that they are good to go and carry on their work, but that is very risky, the virus may develop while in the body and then attack suddenly as soon as the patient ignores their health, and then it will look like the patient died in just 2 days.
<p>
Now if there is any kind of pressure on the patient to work, then they will try to push themselves to work, they will go against their health. It may look very sporty or badass to say that they are continuing their work, despite being covid positive. Such statements may not age well in these volatile times. Once someone is exposed to the virus, there is a lot of uncertainty about what may happen. In such a situation, I think the patient should not have to make decisions or think twice whether they should continue their work or not.
I am not a doctor but in my opinion, the only way out is to give your best to your health, rest as much as one can and not take any other tension, while having enough peace of mind to analyse and be conscious of your health and also take care of people around you.
<p>
I hope we are in agreement so far.
<p>
Now I need to ask you, that according to you, should someone, who is exposed, or has suspected exposure to this disease, go on and test himself how long they can continue their work, or should they fall back immediately with the knowledge that they have a cushion they can rely on?
<p>
It is your choice whether you would accept or pretend not to know the fact that there are professors who are stretching themselves and working to help students in academics even while they are sick. It is not hard to believe either considering that there are 60+ professors infected inside the campus itself. I also know many students who had to give their minors and tests risking their health even when they were infected. Only they know how they went through it.
<p>
I can tell about the situation in Delhi, literally everyone is exposed or has a close one infected with coronavirus. Everyone. Symptoms they may face and the daily numbers we see are just a matter of time. The medical facilities have completely crashed. Even getting tested itself is risky, inaccurate and anyways not possible in the queue. This is why we need a &#34;no-questions-asked&#34; policy. This situation has crippled all the students right from those who would get straight A’s and to those who were already struggling with the workload.
<p>
I think by now you can understand how having a &#34;case-to-case&#34; basis policy is not an acceptable solution to this problem.
In any case, the student who is having to take such a provision will always end up being in a sidelined situation, where they are labelled as a handicapped piece. All the regular classwork will go on while they are the ones &#34;missing out&#34; on them, this way the stage and opportunity is never going to be &#34;equal&#34;, they will be &#34;covering up&#34; some lost work later, and whatever provisions you may make, they are always the disadvantaged set.
<p>
The question now is not whether they can cover up or not, the question is whether you want to give full hearted support or just calculated promises, if not hollow. It is a question of whether this situation makes you accept complete solidarity with everyone, or is your solidarity still a calculated provision for damage control.
<p>
Please take a moment to go back to the doc of the conclusions of the provisions decided by the 215th meeting of the Senate, and ask yourself, have you done justice to this situation and this cause?
<p>
You have also talked in detail how your senate could not find a way to halt the semester or see how that would help the situation, but how come other institutes like IIT Hyderabad, IIT Roorkee are able to find the way and give their students breaks so they can have time and space to cope up with this situation? The Senates might be different, but the students are in the same position in all institutes, how can you rationalise having different policies then?
Maybe you could mail their directors and ask for their constructive inputs about how they have sorted out a plan for the halt and take a page from their book, as even if the internal politics may differ, the common goal of all IITs is to help the students in every way possible.
<p>
Rather than focussing on the main goal for which IITs exist and students aspire to be an IITian, we fret over things like how will the practical labs be held, when to schedule them, how will the degree credit requirements be completed etc. It has been very convenient to announce decisions like &#34;Due to the unprecedented circumstances, we have decided to make the whole year online for first year students&#34;, then why can&#39;t we have decisions like &#34;Due to the unprecedented circumstances, we have decided to drop lab courses for first year UG students&#34;? Which of them looks more dramatic, if you were to judge even from out of context?
<p>
We could even have had simple solutions like cutting time from the summer break and taking a break now. If the situation does not &#34;improve&#34; after a month, or worsens in two, then we would not be in a situation to work anyways, the country would be in a much bigger plague, at that stage, completing lectures won&#39;t even matter, all our infrastructure would be converted in ways to help the situation and gather resources. Why should we always have to plan in a way that we have to see ourselves coming on the top, why is our sight so narrowed?
<p>
I wish there was an equivalent for &#34;looking in the eyes and saying (something)&#34; for email, but can you write to me and say that paying attention to the first year academic syllabus of IIT Delhi is more important than paying attention to the things which have spiked up during this month, or say if it is inconsequential to the challenges we are facing?
<p>
If you believe our education in engineering is about understanding and solving the problems faced in society, then why did the administrative bodies ignore reports by IIT itself which made mathematical models and predicted a peak in September 2020?
<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.20119917v2.full.pdf">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.20119917v2.full.pdf</a>
If the research was so important then why did we not come to any solid solution against covid?  <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/iit-alumni-council-withdraws-from-covid-19-vaccine-development-with-immediate-effect/article32426905.ece">https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/iit-alumni-council-withdraws-from-covid-19-vaccine-development-with-immediate-effect/article32426905.ece</a>
Why are we still ignoring scientific analysis by IIT which predicts the current wave to peak in Mid-May and just talking blindly that &#34;We have no clue when this will get better&#34;, like anyone else would <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09158">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09158</a>
I know here I am talking about things I don&#39;t know as I am just a fresher, and that my questions may sound as trivial as &#34;If God is real, why is there suffering in this world?&#34;. But to be honest it feels quite pointless studying theory when even after studying all this, we are not having a solution. Or at least it would have helped if the administration could pay more respect to these works and make more educated decisions.
<p>
We have reached a state where rather than having the academics help us create solutions, they are instead staggering us down, constricting our minds and not letting us think or work constructively or creatively towards innovative solutions. To do great work and think creatively, we need to have some peace of mind, some free space in our minds to stop and ponder about things, and imagine freely without being under pressure of earning credits from it. It is not possible to have such a free mind when being overburdened or stressed by academics and pending assignments and exams, they reduce productivity otherwise too.
<p>
Such brainstorming can be done only if the students and faculty are given a break to recalibrate and think what they can do, and take some time to digest the changing situation. This is IIT Delhi, the home to one of the brightest students and faculty in the country, if there is any innovation to come, this is the place for it, everyone here has the capability and spirit to work on their level, given the time and space.
<p>
I don&#39;t know if you know about this or not, but even among our freshers there are 10-20 students (BloodConnect), who have straight away given up their own academics and are working day and night arranging covid resources for everyone, literally saving lives. I am sure a lot more of us could have helped in similar initiatives only if we were not asked to choose between getting CG for yourself or getting oxygen for someone you don&#39;t even know, but care about.
<p>
Sir this is no longer a question of just our health, it is about the nature of our administration. It is now a question if, under the most challenging circumstances, would they respect our demands and give full support, is it reliable enough to be trusted by the students for their addressing their needs, or will it question our demands, try to poke holes in our pleadings, and try to negotiate with us instead.
<p>
You have talked about how degree requirements and internships and placements are important. But is it all that IIT Delhi is about? What does being an Institute of Eminence mean to you? Is it just about getting grades, completing degree requirements, getting internships, and landing a job? That could have been done in any other normal college. YouTube has more than its fair share of videos on how to crack FAANG internships. Being IIT Delhi also means a lot about how we take care of the students, the faculty, how we contribute and are ready to help each other, how we become more responsible members of the society, being at a level to understand and solve problems, rather than just one more among the crowd of the many &#34;engineers&#34;.
<p>
Okay you want to teach us.
<p>
But we need to look over what kind of person you are teaching us to become in the long run. In these times, you are asking them to ignore their actual needs, we are normalising sending empty messages of mental health. What kind of engineers will such students become? Are we being trained to accept workplace exploitation and toxic work environments? Or are we turning the entrepreneurial minds into psychopathic capitalists who would question if their workers really deserve a break. Do you realise how you are slowly removing feelings of hope and empathy from the hearts of students, that rather than respecting and taking time to take care of yourself and people whom you can help, you should focus only on your own work selfishly and become successful, hustling through the world.
<p>
<a href="https://www.bspiitd.com/post/the-fault-in-our-senate">https://www.bspiitd.com/post/the-fault-in-our-senate</a>
<p>
I think somewhere through the details and formalities, minute by minute, our Senate has lost the meaning of what IIT is supposed to stand for.
<p>
These times call for some strong leadership from your side and full support towards the students, which is what matters in the end. If at any point, you felt there was something more you could have done to help us, but didn&#39;t, then this is the time to do it.
<p>
